# Smart-Mirror
<p>This DIY Smart Mirror project has been done with the help of an old Android tablet, a glass panel and one way mirror film.</p>
<p>The idea behind this project is for a cheap alternative to the pricey smart mirrors on the market that can provide basic information such as the date and time, weather information, some news tickers and that will also show your upcoming events of the day from your Google Calendar.</p>
<p>The illusion is achieved because of the one way mirror film, in the same way that when it's applied on windows, this film reflects the light coming from outside creating the mirroring effect while allowing the light emitted by the tablet's screen to be visible.</p>
<p>I also used black paper for covering the back of the glass panel, only leaving a portion uncovered for the tablet's screen.</p>
